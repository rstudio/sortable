# sortable 0.4.3 (Release date 2020-06-18)

Breaking changes:

* Moved the `...` dots argument of `sortable_options()` to the first argument,
where previously it was the last argument. This is to prevent partial name
matching resulting in the incorrect sortable option being set.

Other:

* Updated `sortable.js` to version 1.10.2

* Added examples for using the `sortable.js` plugins, specifically multiDrag and
swap.
