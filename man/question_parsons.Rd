\arguments{
\item{...}{parameters passed onto \code{learnr::\link[learnr]{question}}.}

\item{type}{Type of quiz question. Typically this can be automatically determined
based on the provided answers. Pass \code{"radio"} to indicate that even though
multiple correct answers are specified that inputs which include only one correct
answer are still correct. Pass \code{"checkbox"} to force the use of checkboxes
(as opposed to radio buttons) even though only once correct answer was provided.}

\item{correct}{For \code{question}, text to print for a correct answer (defaults
to "Correct!"). For \code{answer}, a boolean indicating whether this answer is
correct.}

\item{incorrect}{Text to print for an incorrect answer (defaults to "Incorrect")
when \code{allow_retry} is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{try_again}{Text to print for an incorrect answer (defaults to "Incorrect")
when \code{allow_retry} is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{message}{Additional message to display along with correct/incorrect feedback.
This message is always displayed after a question submission.}

\item{post_message}{Additional message to display along with correct/incorrect feedback.
If \code{allow_retry} is \code{TRUE}, this message will only be displayed after the
correct submission.  If \code{allow_retry} is \code{FALSE}, it will produce a second
message alongside the \code{message} message value.}

\item{loading}{Loading text to display as a placeholder while the question is loaded}

\item{submit_button}{Label for the submit button. Defaults to \code{"Submit Answer"}}

\item{try_again_button}{Label for the try again button. Defaults to \code{"Submit Answer"}}

\item{allow_retry}{Allow retry for incorrect answers. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{random_answer_order}{Display answers in a random order.}

\item{options}{Options to be supplied to \link{sortable_js} object. See \link{sortable_options} for more details}
}
\description{
Add Parsons Problem tasks to your \code{learnr} tutorials.  The
student can drag-and-drop the answer options into the desired order.

This is a highly experimental, initial attempt at making Parsons problems in
\code{learnr} tutorials.  Parsons problems is a type of programming assignment
where the student must order statements in the correct order.

If the task also includes indentation of the statements, it's called a
second-order Parsons problem. Note that second order problems have not yet
been implemented.

Features (design choices):
\itemize{
\item Items (except the last) in the right hand column will have a \code{\%>\%}
appended.
\item Items (except the first) in the right hand column will automatically be
indented.
\item The initial values are shuffled into random answer order.
}

Lmitations:
\itemize{
\item It does not do any code evaluation
\item It does not support indentation
\item It assumes code is from the \code{tidyverse} and only supports the \code{magrittr}
pipe \code{\%>\%} operator
}
}
\section{Creating a parsons question}{


Use \code{question_parsons} inside a \code{learnr} tutorial chunk

For example:\preformatted{```{r iris}
question_parsons(
 initial = c(
  "iris",
  "mutate(...)",
  "summarize(...)",
  "print()"
 ),
 answer(c(
  "iris",
   "mutate(...)",
  "summarize(...)"
  ), correct = TRUE)
)
```
}

On initialization, the initial values are randomized:

\if{html}{\figure{parsons_app_initial.png}{options: width="60\%" max-width="500px" alt="Figure: Parsons initial state"}}

As the student drags values to the right column, the \code{magrittr} gets
appended, and items are automatically indented:

\if{html}{\figure{parsons_app_submit.png}{options: width="60\%" max-width="500px" alt="Figure: Parsons submit state"}}
}

\examples{
## Example of a shiny app
if (interactive()) {
  app <- system.file("shiny-examples/parsons_app.R", package = "sortable")
  shiny::runApp(app)
}
if (require(learnr, quietly = TRUE)) {
  # to be used within a learnr tutorial...
  question_parsons(
    initial = c(
      "iris",
      "mutate(...)",
      "summarize(...)",
      "print()"
    ),
    answer(c(
      "iris",
      "mutate(...)",
      "summarize(...)"
    ), correct = TRUE)
  )
}

}
