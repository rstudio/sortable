Description: Enables drag-and-drop behaviour in Shiny apps, by exposing the 
    functionality of the 'SortableJS' <https://sortablejs.github.io/Sortable/> 
    JavaScript library as an 'htmlwidget' <http://htmlwidgets.org>. 
    You can use this in Shiny apps and widgets, 'learnr' tutorials as well as 
    R Markdown. In addition, provides a custom 'learnr' question type - 
    'question_rank()' - that allows ranking questions with drag-and-drop.
